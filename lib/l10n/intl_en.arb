    "aboutCardOfADayText": "The card of the day is a hint from MAC that will help you get answers to questions (from personal to financial), find a solution to your problem, and look at a familiar situation from a new perspective. What do we have to do? Formulate your request. The questions can be completely different, depending on what topic you want to explore: 'What direction should I move today/this week?', 'What is stopping me?', 'What is the first step I can take?', 'What?' I’m not happy with what I’m doing, what can I improve, perfect?' The answers can come immediately, at the first glance at the picture. It happens that the association does not arise, and more time is needed to 'stay' with the card. In this case, you can help yourself with additional questions: 'What on the card most attracted my attention?', 'What feelings and emotions does this card evoke in me?', 'How does the character/characters in the picture feel?', 'What will he/they do next?', 'What is happening on the map?', 'What happened up to this moment?', 'What will happen now?', 'Is it me on the map or am I looking at this map?', 'Which of this do I not want to see? Why?', 'How can this card be associated with the answer to my question?', 'How does this image on the map, these associations resonate with my life?', 'Imagine that this is not the whole picture, but part of it. What do you think will be outside the frame, what is the continuation of this picture?'",
